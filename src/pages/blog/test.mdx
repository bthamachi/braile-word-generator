## Introduction

> This article is a continuation of the previous article on deploying a smart contract on the goerli testnet. If you haven't read it yet, you can check it out [here](https://www.bowtiedhamachi.com/articles/my-first-solidity-contract)

In this article, we'll be building out a frontend that interacts nicely with the smart contract that we've deployed on the goerli testnet. We'll be making use of the `web3Modal` library and `ethers` library to interface with the goerli chain.
